This C++ program is a simple Library Management System that allows users to manage book details such as book ID, name, author, student name, price, and number of pages. It provides a menu-driven interface where users can add new books or display the list of stored books. The program uses an array to store up to 20 books and includes basic input validation to prevent errors. Written in C++, it is a console-based application that demonstrates the use of classes, arrays, and loops for managing data efficiently. Clone the repository, compile the code, and run the program to interact with the system and manage book records.
